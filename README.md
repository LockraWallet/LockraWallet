## 🧠 AI Modules

Lockra is powered by modular AI systems that continuously analyze tokens, detect threats, and evolve with the chain. Below are the core engines behind Lockra’s intelligence.

### 🧪 ThreatScan Engine  
Dissects each token’s internal logic to expose hidden risks.

```python
def inspect_token(token):
    issues = []
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        issues.append("Open Mint Access")
    if token.get("freeze_authority") == "active":
        issues.append("Freezable Tokens")
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True):
        issues.append("Liquidity Not Locked")
    return issues
```
#### 🧠 Informed by past exploits and rug blueprints — warns before damage hits

### ⚖️ Stability Index
#### Calculates real trust scores on a 0–100 scale.

```python
def risk_score(token):
    score = 100
    if token.get("blacklist"): score -= 35
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open": score -= 20
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True): score -= 25
    if token.get("owner_changed_recently"): score -= 10
    return max(0, score)
```
#### 📊 Draws from community reports and exploit databases to calibrate real risk

### 🐋 WhaleTrace Scanner
#### Detects supply imbalance and whale clustering.

```javascript
function scanHolders(holders) {
  const whales = holders.filter(h => h.balance >= 0.04);
  return whales.length > 6 ? "Whale Cluster Found" : "Healthy Distribution";
}
```
#### 🧭 Helps prevent hidden dumps and soft rug scenarios by revealing power nodes

### 🌐 TrustLabel Mapper
#### Turns scores into intuitive tags for instant clarity.

```javascript
function label(score) {
  if (score >= 85) return "🟢 Clear"
  if (score >= 50) return "🟡 Watch"
  return "🔴 Hazard"
}
```
#### 🌱 Tags evolve as scam patterns shift and scanning logic improves

### 📈 Behavior Log Engine
#### Tracks how tokens act over time, learning from every move.

```python
def log_behavior(token_id, label, score):
    entry = {
        "token": token_id,
        "label": label,
        "score": score,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    behavior_db[token_id] = {**behavior_db.get(token_id, {}), **entry}
```
#### 📂 Builds long-term intelligence — patterns emerge, red flags mature, and signals strengthen with each block
